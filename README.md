**Author**: Alejandro R. Urzúa (rurz@github)

**Description**: Working repository for the project "Theoretical and computational research in mathematical methods, quantum mechanics and optics" under the program _Becas de Colaboración INAOE 2021_

**Period**: March-August, 2021

**Programming language disclaimer**: This repository is developed as a package in the Julia language to serve as a core for the explaining notebooks inside.

**Content**: 

##### 1. Energy analysis of masses array evolution

##### 2. Study of new coupling laws in masses array

##### 3. Coupled harmonic oscillator phase transitions study in terms of the Lorentz group _**SO(3,1)**_

##### 4. Entanglement and coherence in multi mode Casimir coupling Hamiltonian

##### 5. Wigner-Radon initial amplitude tomography

**Repository structure**:

* Root
  * _src/_ : Main module and scripts with the core functions
  * _docs/_ : Dpcumentation, who are PDF's describing the project, the project logs and reports
  * _notebooks/_ : Interactive notebooks who serve as self-explaining documents for the results achived. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and Pluto.jl notebooks (.jl) are available

(Note: Because we have notebooks, there is a chance to try it directly, without any installation, at a MyBinder.org server)
